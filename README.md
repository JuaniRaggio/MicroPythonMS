# What's this repo for?

Implements missing functionalities for calculators who allow to embed python
programs

Most calculators use MicroPython so that's why none of this functionalities use
libraries

Some programs are not the most efficient ones but to improove them you
should use TI-Basic or the language your calculator supports

Python is the most used language for embed programs into calculators so thats
why I chose it rather than going with TI-Basic

## Simulations

There are some programs to help simulate statistic processes
