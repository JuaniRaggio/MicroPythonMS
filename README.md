# What's this repo for?

- Implements missing functionalities for calculators who allow to embed python
programs.

- Most calculators use MicroPython so that's why none of this functionalities 
use libraries.

- Some programs are not the most efficient ones but to improove them you
should use TI-Basic or the language your calculator supports.

- Python is the most used language for embed programs into calculators so thats
why I chose it rather than going with TI-Basic.

# How to add this functionalities?

1. Clone this repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JuaniRaggio/MicroPythonMS.git
```

2. Connect your calculator using a USB

    If nothing happens once you plug in your calculator, you probably need the
    official app for your calculator. There you can get the instructions to add
    this programs to yours

3. Choose which programs you would like to add and just add those

> [!WARNING] Attention
> Some of this programs need you to edit them each time you use them, such as
> copying the matrix you wish to have, pre-calculate functions such as
> t-student, invNorm, etc. I didn't implement those because every programable
> calculator has them

## Simulations

There are some programs to help simulate statistic processes but the amount of
iterations will be limited to the amount of resources your calculator has
